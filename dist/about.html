<p>I am a second year student at UCLA who is majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I have created this personal website as an exercise to show off the small projects I have worked on in my personal time. I also work in a team with my school newspaper to develop flat pages. I am passionate about software development and love to create things on my own. I would love to develop these skills in any way I can and continue to get real-world experience. <br/><br/>You can contact me at <i>ednawrocki@ucla.edu</i> </p>
