        <p>I created a program to beat the Daily Blitz minigame on the World Series of Poker website. 
        In the minigame, a board of five cards is shown with two hands to choose from.
        The player must click on the higher scoring poker hand in order to advance to the next round. 
        If the player gets all eleven hands correct in the alloted time, they win the jackpot.
        This program uses computer vision software from the opencv python library to read the rank and suit of each card on the screen. 
        Then the program then compares the hands and clicks on the screen accordingly.
        The source code for the project can be found <a href="https://pastebin.com/AG1SZJ6N">here</a>.
